# ETL Pipeline
### In this Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project, data is extracted from the "http://universities.hipolabs.com" API using the 'requests' library. The transformation process is performed using 'pandas' to structure and filter the dataset, with additional filtering to include only universities in California. The resulting DataFrame is modified to concatenate domains and web pages. The 'sqlalchemy' library is employed to load the transformed data into a SQLite database named 'my_lite_store.db.' This project seamlessly integrates 'requests,' 'pandas,' and 'sqlalchemy' for efficient ETL operations, demonstrating the versatility and power of these Python libraries in handling data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.
